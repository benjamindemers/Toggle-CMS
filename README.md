# ToggleCat-CMS
ToggleCat answers a ton of useability issues with WordPress, Drupal and Joomla for the developer.  Built for developers, it is stripped down enough for anyone to use.  One of the best features is that it is designed from the get go to separate front end from back end and to allow for toggling a growing number of modules (TOGS) that are already pre-installed with each new install.   You won't ever be struggling to completely overhaul the look and feel of any creation you make with ToggleCat. The front end is built with bootstrap and has header, footer and stylesheet editors right in the browser.  The menu system as well as the main content area of each page is fully customizable with a browser based editor.  We are working on components as well and they should be added soon.  It's a real work of love by developers for developers.  We hope you like it while it is still open source.  

Our plans are to create a company once this goes SaaS and then you can just sign up for free and build anything you want hosted on the cloud.  Until then, it's on the Hub.  Enjoy.  If you want to work on it that is OK too.  We'd love your input!

Thanks, 

Team ToggleCat
